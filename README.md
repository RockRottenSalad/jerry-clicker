# jerry-clicker
<i>fyi: made by rookie amateur programmer, don't set your expectations too high</i>
<br>needed to practice GTK dev tools, and therefore decided to create a cookie clicker inspired game.<br>
runs on linux and depends on GTK<br>
to run: <br> <br>
download JERRY_CLICKER, save.dat and jerry.png <br> <br>
keep all files inside the same directory <br> <br>
run JERRY_CLICKER by writing: <br>
./JERRY_CLICKER<br>

if you'd like to compile the code yourself:<br>
1: download jerrysourcecode.c, jerry.png and save.dat<br>
2: install the gcc compiler<br>
3: download compile.txt<br>
4: copy the command inside compile.txt and execute it inside the directory with the source code<br><br>

backstory of jerry:<br>
jerry is a dragon model made by a friend of mine<br>
just needed some random image to create this clicker game<br>
the lore isn't any deeper than that
