# jerry-clicker
needed to practice GTK dev tools, and therefore decided to create a cookie clicker inspired game.<br>
runs on linux and depends on GTK<br>
to run: <br> <br>
download JERRY_CLICKER, save.dat and jerry.png <br> <br>
keep all files inside the same directory <br> <br>
run JERRY_CLICKER<br><br>

depends on gtk to run, only works on linux.<br>
