# jerry-clicker
<i>fyi: made by rookie amateur programmer, don't set your expectations too high</i>
<br>Needed to practice GTK dev tools and therefore decided to create a cookie clicker inspired game.<br>
Runs on linux and depends on GTK<br>
To run: <br> <br>
Download JERRY_CLICKER, save.dat and jerry.png <br> <br>
Keep all files inside the same directory <br> <br>
Run JERRY_CLICKER by writing: <br>
./JERRY_CLICKER<br>

If you'd like to compile the code yourself:<br>
1: Download jerrysourcecode.c, jerry.png and save.dat<br>
2: Install the gcc compiler<br>
3: Download compile.txt<br>
4: Copy the command inside compile.txt and execute it inside the directory with the source code<br><br>

Backstory of jerry:<br>
Jerry is a dragon model made by a friend of mine<br>
Just needed some random image to create this clicker game<br>
The lore isn't any deeper than that
